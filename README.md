this repository contains my python project for Eckovation Python Programming course

The files are a mix of batch files, python files and a csv file

This project creates a database in which data is automatically inserted at a certain time from a csv file
the user can get details via student extract , monthly extract and yearly extract batch files
the aim of this project is to create an automatic schedule for attendance of students to be saved and then get details from the database
